# SQL vs NOSQL
## Readings: [Mongo and Mongoose](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)









1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
> If the data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined (for instance, if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records), conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.
2. Give a real world example.
> (for instance, if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records).

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
> Simple schema. High velocity read/write with no frequent updates. High performance and scalability. No complex queries involving multiple keys or joins.

4. Give a real world example.
> Internet of Things, Real-Time Analytics, Content Management

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
> NoSQL databases

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?
> NoSQL databases

1. What does SQL stand for?
> Structured Query Language

2. What is a relational database?
> A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another, Relational databases are based on the relational model.

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
> horizontal structure

4. What is a ‘schema’?
> A database schema is considered the “blueprint” of a database which describes how the data may relate to other tables or other data models.

5. What is a NoSQL database?
> not only SQL, is an approach to database design that enables the storage and querying of data outside the traditional structures found in relational databases

6. How does it work?
> NoSQL databases store data in documents rather than relational tables.

7. What is inside of a Mongo database?
> MongoDB stores data objects in collections and documents instead of the tables and rows used in traditional relational databases.

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
>  MongoDB is more flexible, ensures high and diverse data availability.

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
> The top advantages of NoSQL include its scalability, simplicity, less code, and easy maintenance
