# LinkedList 

- What is a linkedlist ?

> It's a liner data structre, the element (which is called Node) stores in not continues location, each element have a value and pionter (next), the pointer will point to the momery address of the next node in the linkedlist.

- First Node called '**head**'.

## Time complexity

> LinkedList has a sequential access property. It needs to iterate through each element to 
reach a given index, so time complexity to get a value by index from LinkedList is O(N).

- ### Main Linked Lists Operations.

- Insert: inserts an element into the list.

- Delete: removes and returns the specified position element from the list.

- Search: search for exact node.

- Display.

- Data structrue used in big data (google, facebook...etc), more time efficint.
- More memory space, less time.

> used to store a collection of data.

### A node can be added in three ways:

- At the front of the linked list.
- After a given node. 
- At the end of the linked list.
