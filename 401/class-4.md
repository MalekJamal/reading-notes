- What is sequlize?

> Sequelize is an open-source Node. js module that enables JavaScript developers to work with relational databases more easily, including but limited to MySQL, Postgres.(allow you not to use sql quiries or code)

> promise-based, Node. js ORM (Object-relational mapping) for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication, and more.

> Sequelization is the process of connecting a Node.js application to an Object Relational Mapper for better database synchronization.

> More faster than dealing with sql

> Some projects need to works on ORM and some need works on pure SQL, It depends on the company and the size of the project.
